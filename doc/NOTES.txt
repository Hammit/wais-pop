The `bin/spp-log.sh` script is executed each time a Bluetooth
connection using the SPP is made. It logs details about the SPP
connection into '$HOME/tmp/'.

To configure the script to execute, right click the Bluetooth
indicator in the Desktop panel and click Plugins. Then SerialManager
> Configuration > Script to execute on connection.
