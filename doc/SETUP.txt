1. Create a 'wais' user

2. Ensure the system has the correct date and time

3. Schedule regular backups

As the 'wais' user, install the following crontab entry (`crontab -e`)
0 0 * * 1 /home/wais/bin/backup.sh
OR
@weekly /home/wais/bin/backup.sh

This will create weekly backups in $HOME/backup

4. Install Dependencies
`sudo apt-get install vim git python-serial python-dateutil`

5. Configure Sudo
/etc/sudoers.d/wais should contain the following
%adm ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL

6. Ensure Python scripts have access to the ~/lib/ dir
Add the following to ~/.bashrc
`export PYTHONPATH=~/lib`

7. Add 'wais' user to the dialout group (ensuring access to /dev/rfcomm*)
This ensures the 'wais' user has the necessary privileges to execute scripts.
This is important because if sudo is used to escalate privileges then we may
lose important environmental information (like PYTHONPATH)

8. Reboot (or at least logout and login again)
This is necessary to reflect .bashrc and group information changes


NOTES
=====

When executing the Python scripts, ensure you have a valid PYTHONPATH.
For example...
`PYTHONPATH=~/lib ./test-nonin.py`
OR
export PYTHONPATH=~/lib
./test-nonin.py

If you need to use `sudo`, do the following...
sudo PYTHONPATH=/home/wais/lib ./nonin-datetime.py

You will lose the environment variable if you put PYTHONPATH before the sudo

Another technique would be to change sys.path at runtime
`
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/wais/lib/')
`
